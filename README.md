sEMG Silent Speech is the Python module which contains the classes
and methods to deal with different sEMG Silent Speech datasets, models,
visualisations, utility functions and other useful functionality.

A lot of the initial code in this Python module is adapted from the
code released with the

paper in the
[dgaddy/silent_speech](https://github.com/dgaddy/silent_speech) GitHub repository.
Code adapted from this repository will be attributed to correctly under the MIT
